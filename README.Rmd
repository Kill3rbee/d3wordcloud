## d3wordcloud

d3wordcloud is a wrapper for the Word Cloud Layout by Jason Davies.

## How it works?!

The main function `d3wordcloud` needs only `words` and `freqs`. Just like the old good wordcloud package.

## Someone said to customize?

There are a list of parameter for make your word cloud like you want:

<dl>
  <dt>padding</dt><dd>The separation between words</dd>
  <dt>scale</dt><dd>`log`, `linear`, `sqrt`. The scale for `freqs`</dd>
  <dt>font</dt><dd>The separation between words</dd>
  <dt>spiral</dt><dd>The separation between words</dd>
  <dt>rotate.min</dt><dd>The separation between words</dd>
  <dt>rotate.max</dt><dd>The separation between words</dd>
</dl>
