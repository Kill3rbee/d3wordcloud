d3wordcloud
===========

d3wordcloud is a wrapper for the Word Cloud Layout by Jason Davies.

How?!
-----

-   The main function `d3wordcloud` needs only `words` and `freqs`. Just
    like the old good wordcloud package.
-   You can cutomize the output adding `font`, `padding`, `rotate.min`
    and `rotate.max`.
-   You can use in your shiny apps like
    [here](http://r-shiny-apps.jkunst.com/d3wordcloud/) and
    [there](kangurostore.info)

Recommendations
---------------

-   Always have the [latest version of
    packages](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets/issues/100).

    functionality: ([link](https://github.com/adymimos/rWordCloud)).
    Anyway I want add more features and options in this packages.
